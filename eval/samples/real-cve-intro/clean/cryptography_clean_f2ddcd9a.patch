 Memory Safety
 =============
 
-At the time OpenSSL was created, there were no meaningful programming languages that meaningfully provided performance, embeddability, and memory safety — if you wanted a memory safe language, you were committing to giving up performance and adding a garbage collector.

 The world has changed. Nearly 5 years ago, ``pyca/cryptography`` issued our first release incorporating Rust code, and since then we have migrated nearly all functionality to Rust, using a mix of pure-Rust for all parsing and X.509 operations combined with using OpenSSL for providing cryptographic algorithms — gaining performance wins and avoiding several OpenSSL CVEs. `We know these transitions are possible`_.
