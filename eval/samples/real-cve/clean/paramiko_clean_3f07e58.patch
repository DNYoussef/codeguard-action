-    SSH is defined in :rfc-reference:`4251`, :rfc-reference:`4252`,
-    :rfc-reference:`4253` and :rfc-reference:`4254`. The primary working
-    implementation of the protocol is the `OpenSSH project
-    <http://openssh.org>`_.  Paramiko implements a large portion of the SSH
-    feature set, but there are occasional gaps.
+    OpenSSH's RFC specification page is a fantastic resource and collection of
+    links that we won't bother replicating here:
+    https://www.openssh.com/specs.html
+
+    OpenSSH itself also happens to be our primary reference implementation:
+    when in doubt, we consult how they do things, unless there are good reasons
+    not to. There are always some gaps, but we do our best to reconcile them
+    when possible.
